# PracticalProject_Rock-Paper-Scissors
## "Rock â€“ Paper â€“ Scissors" is a simple game, which is part of the practical exercises, in studying with "SoftUni"

The goals of this project are to use some simple logic, such as the popular game "Rock â€“ Paper â€“ Scissors", so as to add my own ideas to further develop the logic, by adding more features of my own, make the game better, or more complicated, or more advanced, or else, thus pricticing my coding skills, as well as exercising handling of a GitHub repository.

(==*Exercising on working with GitHub*[^1] :joy: ==)

The rules of the game are wellknown, as this is a very popular game, however just in brief - the player types one of the following options:

- "rock" or "r"
- "paper" or "p"
- "scissors" or "s"

Then the player presses "Enter" and awaits computer's choice. The winner is shown immediately, e.g. "Out of luck. Computer wins!", or "Luck is on your side. You win!", or "Draw. Better luck next time!", incliuding the count of the score. You get 2 points for a "win", 1 point for a "draw", and 0 points for a "loss", and same applies for the computer. You may also end the game as you choose, by entering "F" for "Finish". But before that, you may as well spend some time, enjoying this console game, taking your chance against the computer ðŸ˜„.
